# 🚀 easyPARM v3.30 Released! 🎉

We’re thrilled to introduce **easyPARM v3.30**, bringing important improvements and a major enhancement to atom type assignment!

## NEW in v3.30:

🛠️ **Bug Fixes** – General stability and reliability improvements across the tool.

🔍 **Enhanced GAFF Atom Type Assignment**
easyPARM now includes an advanced algorithm for atom type assignment that accurately identifies GAFF atom types, even in cases where **Antechamber fails**—especially for **complex, multi-metal structures**.
Using deep analysis of **molecular topology**, **ring systems**, **hybridization states**, and **aromaticity**, easyPARM ensures **precise atom typing** to significantly improve the quality of generated force field parameters.

## Previously in v3.25:

✅ **Non-Interactive Mode** – Automate processing of multiple structures with configuration files
*Thanks to Floris Löffler for this great suggestion!*

## Previously in v3.20:

✅ **Multi-metal Metalloprotein Support** – Handle an **unlimited number of metal atoms**

✅ **Metalloprotein Library Generation** – Seamless integration with `tleap`
